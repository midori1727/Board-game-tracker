This application was created to keep track of board game play history.
You can enter the title, scenario, player (color can be changed by the player), total time, comments about the game session, and you can view, change and delete multiple histories.

This is my first project using redux. I have used actions, reducers and state to facilitate the exchange of data between components.

This application uses responsive design so it works on mobile and tablets.
